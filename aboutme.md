I am just about to finish a PhD in Economics at the Complutense University Madrid, second oldest university in Spain and 10th oldest university world wide according to the [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oldest_universities_in_continuous_operation). I also work for IESE Business School as a researcher in Economics, this blog is a side project to keep a account of some interesting side projects I am working on.
