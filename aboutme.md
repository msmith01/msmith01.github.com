I am just about to finish a PhD in Economics at the Complutense University Madrid, second oldest university in Spain and 10th oldest university world wide according to the [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oldest_universities_in_continuous_operation). I also work for IESE Business School as a researcher in Economics, this blog is a side project to keep an account of some interesting side projects I am working on.

I am not new to R or Python, however I am more actively adding to my github account with code for a number of reasons, one because I think others might like to benefit from what I am doing and secondly in August 2019 my hard drive decided it was time and peacefully went to sleep.

So I decided to just upload what ever I do to here and keep it safe :)
