I currently work on a number of research areas surrounding machine learning and economics. I will update this section in due course, however take a look at my github account for some examples of collecting different data from financial resources.

**Chapter one:** I worked on fundamental financial data in which we applied an Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) in order predict which companies are at most risk of going backrupt in year t based on financial ratiosn in year t-1, t-2, t-3 and t-4.

**Chapter two:** Scraped the SEC website for financial documents - I will upload the code (in R) to scrape these websites shortly.
